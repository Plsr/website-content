A couple of weeks ago, I came across a podcast episode by Ryan Peterman (which I didn't know until then, but highly recommend if you're interested in programming, organizations and career development) with Jake Bolam, who is an IC8 (Principal Engineer) at Meta. I enjoyed the entire episode a lot and would recommend it, but one idea in particular stood out to me.

Jake mentioned that he always approves all Pull Requests he sees. He reviews them, he notes his remarks, but he approves them. That goes as far as approving something that might break production if merged unaddressed. 

My initial thought was that this was crazy. We use GitHub at work and it gives you three buttons, probably for a reason. Why only use one of them, especially if you notice big flaws? But as I often do with ideas that initially sound crazy to my, I gave it a shot, just to see if there is something to it. 

I've been approving every single Pull Request I reviewed for the past couple of weeks now. Here's how it went.
