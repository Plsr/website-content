Today marks the completion of my 34th year on this planet. I don't have 34 life lessons or things I learned in the past year that I can pull out of my sleeve, unfortunately.

I have one thing I learned, though: Even if things don't make sense, just keep going. In his famous speech, Steve Jobs said you can only connect the dots looking backwards, and he's right about that. It has been probably 10 or more years since I first heard this message, but I just now start to really understand it.

A lot of things will not make any sense if you are in the midst of them. You might wonder how any of this will ever be useful or bring your closer to where you want to be. The thing I learned for myself is that what I think where I want to be is very limited in perspective. I don't know half of the place worth being I could end up in, so how could I possibly make being there a goal?

What I also learned is that, if you have good intentions and keep doing your best, you will go somewhere where things briefly make sense. Until they stop making sense.

There is not end goal, not fixed and state when you are done. As long as you keep growing, you will go through periods that don't make any sense at all. And that's good. My life advice for you (not that you asked) is to embrace that.
